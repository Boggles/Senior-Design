# Senior-Design-
The Boggles repository for our 2017-2018 Senior Design Project.

master branch is the main branch for this repository. Only code that is ready for "release" will be placed in the master. NO CHANGES SHOULD BE MADE DIRECTLY TO MASTER. Changes should only be made through group verified commits from 'test'.

test branch will hold all code that is ready for system testing. Unit testing should occur in the init_dev branch.

init_dev is where all development will occur. All files located here have not been finalized for testing and are still under development. Unit testing will occur in this branch.
